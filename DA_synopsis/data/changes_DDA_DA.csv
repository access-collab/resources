On 16 November 2022, Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the Digital Services Act (DSA) entered into force. That Regulation provides a harmonised legal framework applicable to all online intermediary services provided in the Union and seeks to create a safer digital space, in which the fundamental rights of all users of digital services are protected.

Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 includes a special set of obligations for providers of very large online platforms (‘VLOPs’) and of very large online search engines (‘VLOSEs’), proportionate to their particular role and societal impact in the Union. It imposes several obligations on such providers to increase their public accountability, including the obligation to maintain public repositories of advertisements, to draft reports on the assessment of any systemic risks stemming from the design or functioning of their service and its related systems and to adopt risk mitigation measures, as well as the obligation to subject themselves to independent compliance audits.

Article 40 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 requires providers of very large online platforms and of very large online search engines to provide access to their data for the purposes of regulatory supervision and research that contributes to the detection, identification and understanding of systemic risks in the Union, and to the assessment of the adequacy, efficiency and impacts of risk mitigation measures that those providers have to take under that Regulation. The impact of this provision is twofold: researchers will benefit from access to previously undisclosed or under-disclosed data, opening up new avenues for research and increasing the potential of generating knowledge for the benefit of all. At the same time, these insights will contribute to regulators’ work on their enforcement tasks, including the assessment of the measures implemented by those providers to meet the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.

Pursuant to Article 40(13) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement that Regulation by laying down the technical conditions under which providers of very large online platforms or of very large online search engines are to share data pursuant to Article 40, paragraphs 1 and 4, of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 and the purposes for which the data may be used. In addition, the provision states that those delegated acts shall lay down the specific conditions under which such sharing of data with researchers can take place in compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, as well as relevant objective indicators, procedures and, where necessary, independent advisory mechanisms in support of sharing of data, taking into account the rights and interests of the providers of very large online platforms or of very large online search engines and the recipients of the service concerned, including the protection of confidential information, in particular trade secrets, and maintaining the security of their service.

Given the important role that researchers can play for the detection, identification and understanding of systemic risks in the Union and for the assessment of the adequacy, efficiency and impacts of risk mitigation measures that providers of very large online platforms and of very large online search engines are required to take under Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, this delegated act specifies the procedures and technical conditions enabling the sharing of the data pursuant to Article 40, paragraph 4. To this end, this delegated act is intended to ensure an effective and harmonised application of the provision regulating access to data pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.

The rules laid down in this delegated act build on existing practices for accessing data from providers of very large online platforms or of very large online search engines, which were set up on a voluntary basis. Considering the innovative nature of the mechanism set out in Article 40(4) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 involving different actors, namely researchers, Digital Services Coordinators and providers of very large online platforms or of very large online search engines, specific procedures are defined to develop solid, consistent and uniform practices, and to protect the rights and interests of all the actors involved.

In particular, the delegated act sets out the procedures to be followed by Digital Services Coordinators for the formulation of reasoned requests for access to data to providers of very large online platforms or of very large online search engines. In doing so, this delegated act also clarifies and harmonises the procedures for the management of the data access process, starting from the submission of the data access application and it establishes the Digital Services Act (DSA) data access portal, to underpin the different steps in the process. Moreover, the delegated act pays particular attention to the legal, organisational and technical safeguards to be taken into account by the Digital Services Coordinator of establishment when determining the appropriate access modalities for the sharing of the data. To this end, the delegated act operationalises the interactions between the Digital Service Coordinator of establishment and the providers of very large online platforms or of very large online search engines in the processing of the reasoned request for access to data.

The delegated act therefore aims at designing a practical and clear process for data access, which will protect the rights and interests of those involved – while containing adequate safeguards against any form of abuse.","1. CONTEXT OF THE DELEGATED ACT

Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 includes a special set of obligations for providers of very large online platforms and of very large online search engines, proportionate to their particular role and societal impact in the Union. The obligations imposed on those providers seek to increase their public accountability and include the obligation to maintain public repositories of advertisements, to publish reports at least once a year on the results of their assessment of any systemic risks stemming from the design, functioning or use of their service and its related systems, and on the risk mitigation measures they put in place, as well as reports resulting from independent compliance audits.

Article 40 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 requires providers of very large online platforms and of very large online search engines to provide access to the data they hold for the purposes of regulatory supervision, research and scrutiny that contributes to the detection, identification and understanding of systemic risks in the Union, and to the assessment of the adequacy, efficiency and impacts of risk mitigation measures that those providers have to take  under that Regulation. The impact of this provision is twofold: researchers who fulfil the conditions set out in the provision will benefit from access to previously undisclosed or under-disclosed data, opening up new avenues for research and increasing the potential of generating knowledge for the benefit of all. At the same time, these insights will contribute to the work of competent authorities in carrying out their supervision and enforcement tasks, including the assessment of the steps taken by providers of very large online platforms and of very large online search engines to fulfil their obligations under Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.

Pursuant to Article 40(13) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, the Commission shall adopt delegated acts to supplement that Regulation by laying down the technical conditions under which providers of very large online platforms or of very large online search engines are to share data pursuant to Article 40, paragraphs 1 and 4, of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 and the purposes for which the data may be used.

Their findings can constitute valuable input for the enforcement of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 and foster accountability of providers of very large online platforms and of very large online search engines."
Rec3,1,1,Rec2,1,2,"To make the data sharing according to Article 40(4) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 work, clear rules are needed for efficient sharing of data by providers of very large online platforms or of very large online search engines with vetted researchers. This includes setting out the steps and technical conditions needed to ensure that data is shared securely and efficiently.","The purpose of this Regulation is to lay down the technical conditions and the procedures necessary to enable such access, in a secure and efficient manner that is consistent across all Digital Services Coordinators, and in a way that ensures equality of treatment for researchers and data providers."
Rec4,1,1,Rec3,1,1,"To ensure that the data access process is transparent and consistent across Digital Services Coordinators, and to make this process clear and easy-to-use, it is necessary to create a dedicated digital infrastructure (‘the DSA data access portal’). That portal should enable researchers, data providers, and Digital Services Coordinators to access and exchange information, communications, and updates on ongoing processes.","To ensure that the data access process is consistent across all Digital Services Coordinators and to make that process clear and transparent for everyone, it is necessary to create a dedicated digital infrastructure (‘the DSA data access portal’). The DSA data access portal should allow researchers, data providers, and Digital Services Coordinators to participate in the data access process, have access to and disseminate relevant information, such as the details of the dedicated points of contact, and communicate with one another. The DSA data access portal should not be considered as one of the access modalities to be used for the provision of access to the data pursuant to a reasoned request."
Rec4,1,2,Rec4,1,1,"To ensure that Digital Services Coordinators can access information submitted via the DSA data access portal without needing to create a separate account in the portal, the DSA data access portal should be interoperable with the information sharing system AGORA established by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/6073.","Data providers, and researchers wishing to participate in the data access process, should create an account on the DSA data access portal for that purpose. To ensure that Digital Services Coordinators can access information submitted via the DSA data access portal without needing to create a separate account on the portal, the DSA data access portal should be interoperable with the information sharing system AGORA established in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/6073."
,,,Rec5,1,1,,"To ensure transparency of the data access process for all the parties involved and to monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of the data access process and compliance with Article 40(4) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 and this Regulation, the DSA data access portal should generate automatic notifications in relation to different steps and updates of the process."
Rec5,1,1,Rec6,1,1,"To make it easier for researchers to participate in the data access process, they should be given clear information about the procedures for applying for access to data. Digital Services Coordinators should therefore put in place dedicated information pages, including links to the DSA data access portal, allowing researchers to find information on the data access process.","In order to provide researchers with consistent information about the data access process, Digital Services Coordinators should make available and easily accessible on their online interfaces information concerning the data access process, including links to the DSA data access portal. To avoid creating unnecessary administrative burden, increase efficiency and facilitate communication among all parties involved in the data access process, Digital Services Coordinators are encouraged to facilitate the management of information related to the data access process, also from a linguistic perspective."
Rec6,1,1,Rec7,1,1,"To help applicant researchers to design effective research projects and to reduce the administrative burden of the data access process, data providers should provide an overview of the data inventory of their services easily accessible online, including indications on the data and data structures available, and where possible, indicate suggested modalities for accessing them.","In order to allow researchers to identify the relevant data for the purposes set out in Article 40(4) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, data providers should make available DSA data catalogues for their services. Such catalogues should be easily findable and accessible on the online interfaces of data providers, and should describe the available data assets, their data structure and metadata, access to which may be requested pursuant to Article 40(4) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. When making available the DSA data catalogues, data providers should have regard to risks to confidentiality, data security or personal data protection potentially deriving from such information being made public."
,,,Rec8,1,1,,"To contribute to the development of relevant research projects for the purposes set out in Article 40(4) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, the DSA data catalogues should include in particular data related to the systemic risks in the Union that data providers have identified in their annual risk assessments pursuant to Article 34 of that Regulation, as well as data related to any risk mitigation measures referred to in Article 35 of that Regulation. To ensure the relevance and timeliness of the DSA data catalogues, those catalogues should be updated regularly with due consideration to newly identified systemic risks and the evolution of systemic risks. For example, they should reflect emerging risks identified following an ad hoc risk assessment pursuant to Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 or following an audit report pursuant to Article 37 of that Regulation. To minimise the procedural burden on the data providers, where appropriate, such catalogues may rely on existing data documentation resources used for other purposes and audiences, such as advertising, content creation, or third-party app development. The DSA data catalogues should not be required to be exhaustive and therefore should not bind or limit applicant researchers in their data access applications."
,,,Rec9,1,1,,"In order to facilitate the determination of the access modalities by the Digital Services Coordinator of establishment and reduce the overall burden of the data access process on all actors involved, data providers should publish their suggested access modalities for the data described in the DSA data catalogues. These suggested access modalities should be proportionate to the sensitivity of the data and include information on the possible technical, organisational and legal conditions considered by the data providers as appropriate to enable the provision of the data. The access modalities suggested by data providers should not bind Digital Services Coordinators of establishment, who should remain competent to determine the appropriate access modalities."
Rec7,1,1,Rec10,1,1,"To ensure that data access application are treated equally, independently of the Member State from which the reasoned request originates, the timeframe for the formulation of reasoned requests should be harmonised. In case the formulation of the reasoned request requires additional time, the Digital Services Coordinator of establishment should notify the principal researcher, giving reasons for the delay. Such reasons may include the need to carry out additional verifications, for example where data access applications imply international data transfers, or where the Digital Services Coordinator of establishment has detected risks to the security of the Union if the data were to be shared. Making use of any independent advisory mechanism should not be among the reasons causing the delay.","To ensure that data access applications are treated equally, independently of the Digital Services Coordinator to which the data access application is submitted or from which the reasoned request originates, the timeframe for the formulation of reasoned requests should be specified to ensure consistency across all Digital Services Coordinators. If the formulation of the reasoned request requires additional time, the Digital Services Coordinator of establishment should notify the principal researcher, giving reasons for the delay. Such reasons may include the need for additional verifications by the Digital Services Coordinator of the research organisation or of establishment, for example where data access applications imply international data transfers, or where the Digital Services Coordinator of establishment has identified potential risks to the security of the Union if the data were to be shared. With a view to aligning also the steps in the data access process preceding the formulation of reasoned requests, including the assessment of data access applications and granting of vetted researcher status, Digital Services Coordinators are encouraged to develop a consistent and coordinated way of working, including common operational criteria, within the framework of the European Board for Digital Services."
Rec8,1,1,Rec11,1,1,"To ensure that the Digital Services Coordinator of establishment has all the information necessary to formulate the reasoned request, the Digital Services Coordinator to which the data access application was submitted, should verify that the data access application includes the relevant information and supporting documentation. Within 5 working days from the receipt of the data access application, the principal researcher should receive a confirmation of completeness or be notified about the possibility to correct and resubmit the data access application if information or supporting documentation are missing.","In order to streamline the procedures for the formulation of reasoned requests, all Digital Services Coordinators of establishment should be required to verify that certain common elements of the data access process were duly covered in the data access applications."
Rec9,1,1,Rec11,1,2,"As a prerequisite for formulating a reasoned request, the Digital Services Coordinator of establishment should verify whether all applicant researchers who are mentioned in the data access application have provided the relevant documentation demonstrating their affiliation to a research organisation, such as employment contracts or any other form of legal association.","To that end, the Digital Services Coordinators of establishment should verify that all applicant researchers who are mentioned in the data access application demonstrated their affiliation to a research organisation, for example by providing documentary evidence of employment contracts or any other form of legal association with the research organisation."
Rec9,1,2,Rec11,1,3,"The Digital Services Coordinator of establishment should also verify that documentation demonstrating their independence from commercial interests and their access to the available legal, organisational and technical means to meet the requirements of confidentiality, data security and protection of personal data has been provided, for example in the form of a commitment letter by the research organisation of affiliation of each applicant researcher.","The Digital Services Coordinators of establishment should also verify that the applicant researchers demonstrated their independence from commercial interests, for example, by means of a declaration to that effect."
Rec10,1,1,Rec12,1,1,"The Digital Services Coordinator of establishment should verify that the funding of the research project for which the data are requested is disclosed. The information provided by the applicant researchers should include details of financial and non-financial contributions, such as the amount, the nature of the contribution and the funding entity, as well as, where applicable, relevant references to EU funded projects.","The Digital Services Coordinator of establishment should verify that the funding of the research project for which the data are requested is disclosed in the data access application.

Where available, the data access application should also include the outcomes of evaluations conducted by the entity or entities providing the funding."
Rec11,1,1,,,,"The Digital Services Coordinator of establishment should verify whether the data access application describes how the research project for which the data are requested is relevant for the purposes laid out in Article 40(4) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 and includes information on the research questions addressed and the planned methodology for conducting the research. Where available, the data access application should include the outcomes of evaluations concerning the scientific merits of the research projects conducted by the research organisation of affiliation or the entity providing the funding, including references to evaluation processes conducted in relation to EU funded projects.",

The data that can be applied for to study systemic risks in the Union may vary over time. ","The Digital Services Coordinator of establishment should verify that the data access application describes how the data and data format are selected, with reference to the requirements of necessity for, and proportionality to, the purpose of the envisaged research. Where the requested data are also available through other sources, the Digital Services Coordinator of establishment should assess whether the request for such data in the data access application is duly justified, having regard to the information in the data access application. Possible justifications may include evidence of poor quality or unreliability of such data deriving from other sources or the unsuitability of the format in which such data may be retrieved from other sources for the purposes of the research project, which would hinder the performance of the research project. Data that can be requested in order to study systemic risks or their mitigation in the Union may evolve in the future."
